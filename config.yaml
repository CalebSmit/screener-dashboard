# Within-Category Metric Weights (each category sums to 100)
# Rationale: Weights reflect data reliability, research support, and
# resistance to manipulation. Cash-flow metrics > accounting metrics.
metric_weights:
  valuation:
    ev_ebitda: 25      # Capital-structure-neutral; LTM EBIT + LTM D&A (quarterly cashflow)
    fcf_yield: 40      # Highest: cash flow is hardest to manipulate
    earnings_yield: 20 # Simple P/E inverse; well-understood but accrual-based
    ev_sales: 15       # Lowest: ignores margins, but useful for loss-making firms
    pb_ratio: 0        # Bank-only; active weight in bank_metric_weights

  quality:
    roic: 30           # Highest: LTM NOPAT/IC; excess cash capped 50%, IC floored 10% TA
    gross_profit_assets: 25  # Novy-Marx quality factor; above operating expenses
    debt_equity: 20    # Leverage risk; uses MRQ BS debt for temporal consistency
    piotroski_f_score: 15  # Composite health; 9 binary signals
    accruals: 10       # Earnings quality; Sloan 1996

    equity_ratio: 0    # Bank-only

  growth:
    forward_eps_growth: 35  # Highest: forward-looking consensus estimates
    peg_ratio: 20      # Growth-adjusted valuation
    revenue_growth: 30 # Top-line growth; harder to manipulate than earnings
    sustainable_growth: 15  # LTM ROE(avg equity) × retention; SGR clamped [0%,100%]

  momentum:
    return_12_1: 50    # Classic Jegadeesh-Titman momentum signal
    return_6m: 50      # Medium-term momentum; equal weight for diversification

  risk:
    volatility: 60     # Direct risk measure; higher weight than beta
    beta: 40           # Systematic risk relative to market

  revisions:
    analyst_surprise: 40       # Backward-looking: did company beat estimates? (was 65)
    price_target_upside: 20   # Forward-looking: analyst consensus upside (was 35)
    earnings_acceleration: 20  # NEW: most recent surprise % > prior quarter surprise %
    consecutive_beat_streak: 20  # NEW: count of consecutive positive surprises (0-4)
    # NOTE: EPS forecast revision (change in consensus FWD EPS over 3-6 months) would be
    # ideal as a fifth metric here, but yfinance does not provide historical consensus data.
    # Future enhancement: integrate I/B/E/S data from FactSet or Refinitiv.

# Bank-Specific Metric Weights

# Piotroski F-Score Conditional Weighting
# When enabled, reduces Piotroski weight for stocks with LOW valuation scores

# Only affects non-bank stocks (bank quality weights are independent).

# Value Trap Filters
# Logic: MAJORITY (2-of-3) — a stock is flagged if at least 2 of the 3
# dimensions (quality, momentum, revisions) breach their floor percentile.
# Rationale: OR logic (any 1 breach) flagged ~60% of the universe, which
# was too aggressive. Majority logic catches stocks with genuinely broad
# weakness while tolerating a single weak dimension.

# Growth Trap Filters
# Logic: MAJORITY (2-of-3) — a stock is flagged if it has high growth but
# at least 2 of the 3 dimensions (growth ceiling, quality floor, revisions floor)
# breach their threshold. Catches "growth at any price" stocks.
